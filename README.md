# Courses
To whoever it may concern

This repository contains the proof of my completition of some of my interesting courses I took over the years as a student but I did not have the funding to get a certification. It contains screenshots at the very base to prove the completion of my course. Mostly my courses are taken from coursera where I have been rejected multiple times of a financial aid or some requests are still in progress.
